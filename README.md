# Deploy Next.js to GitHub Pages

https://youssoufdasilva.github.io/atf2025-gh-pages/

This is a Next.js template which can be deployed to GitHub Pages as a static site.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1.  Create a new public GitHub repository
1.  Edit `next.config.ts` to match your GitHub repository name:
    - Given the pattern `https://github.com/<user>/<repo>`
    - Update your `basePath` config to the name of your repo (e.g. `/repo`)
1.  Push the starter code to the `main` branch
1.  Run the `deploy` script (e.g. `npm run deploy`) to create the `gh-pages` branch
1.  On GitHub, go to **Settings** > **Pages** > **Branch**, and choose `gh-pages` as the branch with the `/root` folder. Hit **Save**
1.  Make a change
1.  Run the `deploy` script again to push the changes to GitHub Pages

Congratulations! You should have a URL like:

```bash
https://<github-user-name>.github.io/<github-project-name>/
```
